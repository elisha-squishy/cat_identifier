this was my highschool electronics project. hope you like it. 
I uploaded 3 files: the trainer for the AI model, a program that opens the computer's camera and checks on the model if what the camera shows in the cat in question, and an arduino script.
the arduino script has a lot of functionality but the code is pretty self explanitory so feel free to drop any functions you don't want to use. it uses: a distance sensor, a servo moter, and an mp3 player. maybe some more stuff
setup: connect the arduino to the computer with a serial cable. modifying the code to run on a raspberry pi sounds like a good idea, but for some reason was a nightmare for me.
good luck and have fun!
